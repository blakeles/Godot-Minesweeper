# Godot-Minesweeper

This is my second godot project.
I wanted to use a tile/block game like my previous project, however, I used a tilemap to generate the game this time around, rather than using individual scenes. This actually made a lot more sense and I was able to get a quick working game within about half an hour. Minesweeper was simpler to develop than block puzzle, and only took me a few hours to finish.

This has once again been a good learning experience and I now believe I should have used a tilemap for Block Puzzle. I will continue to make small projects like this and developing my skills with Godot and GDScript.
